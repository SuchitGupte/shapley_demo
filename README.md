# Shapley Demo

This repository contains a demonstration of Shapley value approximations for model interpretability in tabular datasets. Shapley values are a principled way to attribute the output of a machine learning model to its input features, enabling model-agnostic and theoretically grounded explanations.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

The codebase provides:

- Efficient implementations for computing exact and approximate Shapley values.
- Utilities for evaluating explanation fidelity using ground truth comparisons.
- Experiments across various model types and data modalities (regression and classification).
- Visualizations to assess performance and trade-offs of different strategies.
